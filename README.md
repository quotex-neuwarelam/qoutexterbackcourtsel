# Quotex Bot Free: Automated Trading for Beginners

## What is Quotex?

Quotex is a binary options trading platform that allows traders to
speculate on the price movements of various assets, including
currencies, commodities, and stocks. Binary options are contracts that
pay out a fixed amount if the trader correctly predicts the direction of
the asset\'s price movement within a specified time frame.
